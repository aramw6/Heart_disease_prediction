# Heart_disease_prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health indicators. Using a dataset containing medical records, several machine learning algorithms were applied to build a robust predictive model.

Features:
- Age: Age of the patient.
-Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female).
-Chest Pain Type (cp): Type of chest pain experienced by the patient.
-Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps): Patient's resting blood pressure.
Serum Cholesterol (chol): Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl.
Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs): Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).
Resting ECG (restecg): Resting electrocardiographic results.
Max Heart Rate (thalach): Maximum heart rate achieved.
Exercise Induced Angina (exang): Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
ST Depression (oldpeak): ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
Number of Major Vessels (ca): Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
Thalassemia (thal): A blood disorder type (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect).
Target Variable:
Target: Presence of heart disease (1 = disease; 0 = no disease).
